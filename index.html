     <p>You wake to the sound of a scream, only to 
        find yourself in cold and damp room deep 
        underground. Up above you see a grate with 
        moon light peaking through. You pick yourself 
        up, dusting off your cloak. In the circular 
        room there is only a lone pedestal. It sat in 
        the center of the room, barely visible in 
        the slivers of moonlight.
     </p>
     <p>You approach the pedestal and see a crimson 
        key. With each step you feel drawn to the beautiful 
        key, but when the scream sounds again you 
        regain your senses. Suddenly the key looks 
        darker with a strange aura, a faint purple glow 
        you hadn't notice before. Despite the ominous 
        feeling, you grab the key, and a voice now calls 
        to your from above. 
     </p>
     <p>"Do not be afriad, living one, for I am the moon. 
        The world is in terrible danger, the hope of your
         kind has been taken. You have been summond here 
         to find her before it is to late. Great dangers lie 
         ahead. I can only see where my light touches, so 
         I am afrid my guidence is limited. Follow your 
         insticts, for the fate of hope is up to you. The key 
         will allow you to enter any of the passages you 
         encounter along your way."    
      </p>
     <p>The moon went quiet, offering nothing more. You 
        look to the five passages surrounding you. Each door 
        hidden beneath a vail of shadow. You close your eyes 
        and listen, when a scream calls once more, you decide 
        which path to take...
